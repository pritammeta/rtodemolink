                <p class="toc"><span>This chapter is an introduction to workplace health and safety and
                    discusses your personal obligations around being safe at work as
                    well as your employer’s obligations to you whilst at work. It also
                    introduces key regulations, terms and concepts of workplace health
                    and safety, some of which will then be expanded on in Chapter 2</span> </p>

                            As an example, going on patrol at
                            night with no radio and torch is a
                            hazard. The risk of personal danger
                            is high. The increased exposure you
                            would be in since you would not be able to ask for
                            back up from other team members if you needed
                            it, would place this in the high-risk category</p>
